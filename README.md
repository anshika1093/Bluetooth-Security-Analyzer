# Bluetooth-Security-Analyzer

I developed a "Bluetooth Security Analyzer" tool that helps users identify and fix security risks in Bluetooth connections. The tool makes it easy to discover nearby Bluetooth devices, scan for weaknesses in the connection and device settings, analyze traffic, and provide solutions to prevent attacks. Since Bluetooth connections can expose users to threats like eavesdropping or unauthorized pairing, this tool helps by offering clear advice on how to strengthen security and protect personal data.
